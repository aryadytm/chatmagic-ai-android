## NOTE

## DESCRIPTION

ChatMagic AI is artificial intelligence chatbot that works like OpenAI ChatGPT but runs locally on mobile phones without internet connection (offline first). ChatMagic AI uses LLM (Large Language Model) finetuned on chat-instruction dataset. Thanks to a custom runtime, quantization, and various model optimizations, I've managed to make a LLM with approximately 400 million parameters run in mobile devices consuming below 500 MB RAM with decent generation speed which is below 0.1s per token.
